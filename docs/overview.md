Flexdoc Property Decision Engine

Overview Specification v1.0

1. Purpose and scope

The Flexdoc Property Decision Engine exists to guide long-term residential property investment decisions in Australia.

Its purpose is to reduce emotional decision-making and prevent permanent capital mistakes.

The engine does not support speculation, short-term trading, or non-residential property.

2. Foundational beliefs

Flexdoc believes residential property investment matters for four structural reasons.

Residential real estate is a time-proven asset across cycles, policy regimes, and generations.

Investment property provides housing security and social utility when managed responsibly.

In an era of ongoing currency debasement, real assets protect purchasing power over long time horizons.

Residential property generates income, which can support prudent gearing when structured carefully.

These beliefs inform every downstream rule in the engine.

3. Asset and market scope

The engine operates within a deliberately narrow universe.

Asset class is limited to residential real estate only.
Commercial, industrial, and specialised property types are excluded.

Geographic scope is limited to Australia.

Location preference is for metropolitan areas or large regional centres with population catchments of at least 50,000 to 100,000 people.

Liquidity is mandatory.
Illiquid markets are excluded regardless of perceived upside.

4. Location framework

Location quality is assessed using the PIES methodology.

Population growth that supports sustained housing demand.

Investment in infrastructure that improves access, productivity, and livability.

Employment growth across diverse and resilient industries.

Supply constraints that limit excessive new housing stock.

Strength across multiple PIES dimensions is required.
Single-factor narratives are insufficient.

5. Decision philosophy

The engine is built from the outside in.
Personal constraints come before asset selection.

Deposit size is the primary starting point and defines the opportunity set.

Borrowing capacity must be understood before property selection.
Formal assessment is preferred, but reasonable estimates are acceptable early.

Time horizon is a mandatory input.
Short, medium, and long-term holds require different decisions.

Exit strategy must be explicit.
Tax consequences are treated as real costs, not afterthoughts.

If the foundation is weak, asset quality cannot compensate.

6. Risk framework

The engine distinguishes between risks that affect cash flow and risks that threaten capital.

Income risk

Income risk relates to the ability to sustain the asset over time.

This includes sensitivity to interest rate movements, income volatility, and cash flow gaps.

Borrowing capacity is used to test resilience, not approval likelihood.

Assets that only work under perfect conditions are considered fragile.

Capital risk

Capital risk arises from the asset itself.

This includes major repairs, asset defects, zoning or planning changes, and capital expenditure exposure, including strata risks.

Capital risks are treated as potentially permanent.

External risks

Macro-economic conditions, tax changes, and sovereign risk are recognised and monitored.

These risks are contextualised rather than used as binary decision blockers.

Income risk tests survivability.
Capital risk tests irreversibility.

7. Decision mechanics

The engine operates as a staged filtering system.

First, a comprehensive fact find captures all critical inputs.

Second, the client is matched to suitable locations using scope rules and PIES screening.

Third, asset type is matched within approved locations based on budget and capacity, such as apartment versus house.

Fourth, liquidity and transactability are assessed using listing depth, demand, and supply dynamics.

Each stage deliberately narrows the decision set.

8. Outputs

The engine outputs strategy before property.

Each client is classified into a predefined Flexdoc investment strategy.

Each strategy contains approved locations, asset types, and structural assumptions.

Individual properties may change over time.
The underlying strategy remains stable.

Strategies are governed through a separate database and decision engine.

Strategy is treated as intellectual property.
Listings are treated as inputs.

9. Strategy taxonomy

The engine begins with four base strategies.

New investor with moderate income.

New investor with high income.

Existing investor with moderate income.

Existing investor with high income.

These strategies are intentionally broad and can be refined later.

10. Strategy definitions
Strategy A: New investor, moderate income

Objective is capital preservation and execution simplicity.

Asset bias is intentionally undefined at this stage.

Location bias prioritises high liquidity.

Gearing posture is conservative.

Time horizon is medium to long-term.

Exit preference leans toward equity extraction.

Strategy B: New investor, high income

Objective is efficient capital deployment with future scalability.

Asset bias is intentionally undefined.

Location bias has a strong metro preference.

Gearing posture is moderately assertive.

Time horizon is long-term.

Exit strategy is flexible.

Strategy C: Existing investor, moderate income

Objective is portfolio resilience and optimisation.

Asset bias is intentionally undefined.

Location bias is diversification-aware.

Gearing posture is controlled.

Time horizon is long-term.

Exit strategy focuses on equity management.

Strategy D: Existing investor, high income

Objective is long-term portfolio compounding.

Asset bias is intentionally undefined.

Location bias is broad but liquidity constrained.

Gearing posture is strategic.

Time horizon is long-term.

Exit strategy is opportunistic.

11. Non-negotiables and gating logic

Global non-negotiables apply across all strategies.

Non-residential assets are excluded.

Illiquid locations are excluded.

Undefined time horizons invalidate decisions.

No credible exit path results in rejection.

Strategy-level non-negotiables exist but thresholds remain undefined at this stage.

Unknowns are placeholders, not assumptions.

12. Decision outcomes

Each assessment produces:

A strategy classification.

Approved locations and asset types.

Decision status of Proceed, Conditional, Refer, or Reject.

A confidence level.

A plain-English explanation of the outcome.

13. Governance and evolution

All rule and strategy changes are versioned.

Changes require documented rationale.

Outcomes inform future refinements.

Unknowns are resolved through evidence, not intuition.

14. Final principle

Flexdoc does not optimise for speed or excitement.

It optimises for durable decision quality.

The engine exists to enforce discipline when emotion is loud.
